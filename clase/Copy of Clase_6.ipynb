It accomplishes this by identifying the principal components, which are new orthogonal variables that capture the maximum variance in the data.\n","\n","**Steps of PCA:**\n","\n","1. **Standardization:** Before applying PCA, it is important to standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis. The standardized value for a feature x is calculated as follows:\n","\n","   ![Standardization Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\\dpi{150}&space;\\bg_white&space;z&space;=&space;\\frac{x&space;-&space;\\mu}{\\sigma})\n","\n","   where z is the standardized value, x is the original value, μ is the mean of the feature, and σ is the standard deviation of the feature.\n","\n","2. **Covariance Matrix:** Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix measures the relationships between pairs of features and provides insights into the data's variance structure. The covariance between two features x and y is calculated as follows:\n","\n","   ![Covariance Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\\dpi{150}&space;\\bg_white&space;Cov(x,&space;y)&space;=&space;\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i&space;-&space;\\bar{x})(y_i&space;-&space;\\bar{y}))\n","\n","   where Cov(x, y) is the covariance between x and y, n is the number of samples, xi and yi are the standardized values of x and y, and 𝑥̅ and 𝑦̅ are the means of x and y, respectively.\n","\n","3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition:** Perform eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix to obtain the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each principal component. The eigenvalue decomposition equation is as follows:\n","\n","   ![Eigenvalue Decomposition Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\\dpi{150}&space;\\bg_white&space;\\mathbf{C}&space;\\mathbf{v}&space;=&space;\\lambda&space;\\mathbf{v})\n","\n","   where C is the covariance matrix, v is the eigenvector, λ is the eigenvalue.\n","\n","4. **Selecting Principal Components:** Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top k eigenvectors corresponding to the highest eigenvalues. These eigenvectors constitute the principal components that capture the most significant variation in the data.\n","\n","5. **Projection:** Project the original data onto the selected principal components to obtain the transformed dataset in the lower-dimensional space. The transformed value for a sample x is calculated as follows:\n","\n","   ![Projection Formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\\dpi{150}&space;\\bg_white&space;\\mathbf{y}&space;=&space;\\mathbf{x}&space;\\mathbf{W})\n","\n","   where y is the transformed value, x is the original value, and W is the matrix formed by concatenating the selected eigenvectors.\n","\n","Certainly! Here's the section on interpreting PCA, repeated for your convenience:\n","\n","**Interpreting PCA:**\n","\n","PCA provides several insights into the data:\n","\n","- The eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each principal component. Larger eigenvalues correspond to principal components that capture more variation in the data.\n","\n","- The eigenvectors (principal components) are orthogonal to each other. They represent new axes in the transformed space, where each axis captures a different aspect of the data's variance.\n","\n","- The cumulative explained variance can be calculated by summing the eigenvalues. It helps determine the number of principal components needed to retain a desired amount of information. The cumulative explained variance up to the k-th principal component can be calculated as follows:\n","Explained Variance_cumulative(k) = (∑_{i=1}^{k} λ_i) / (∑_{j=1}^{p} λ_j)\n","where Explained Variance_cumulative(k) is the cumulative explained variance up to the k-th principal component, λ_i is the eigenvalue of the i-th principal component, and p is the total number of principal components.\n","\n","- The principal components can be interpreted in terms of feature importance. The higher the absolute value of the component's coefficients, the more it contributes to the variance in the data. Positive coefficients indicate a positive correlation with the component, while negative coefficients indicate a negative correlation.\n","\n","- PCA can also be visualized by plotting the transformed data in the reduced-dimensional space. Each point represents a sample, and the axes correspond to the principal components. By examining the distribution of samples, patterns, clusters, or separability in the transformed space can be observed.\n","\n","By understanding and interpreting the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, cumulative explained variance, feature importance, and visualizations, we can gain valuable insights into the underlying structure and patterns in the data through PCA.\n","\n","**Applications of PCA:**\n","\n","- *Dimensionality Reduction:* PCA is primarily used for dimensionality reduction, where high-dimensional datasets are transformed into lower-dimensional representations while preserving most of the information.\n","\n","- *Data Visualization:* PCA can be used to visualize high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions by projecting it onto the principal components. This allows for better understanding and interpretation of the data.\n","\n","- *Noise Reduction:* PCA can help in denoising data by removing noise-related principal components that contribute little to the overall variance. By discarding the components with lower eigenvalues, noise can be reduced in the reconstructed data.\n","\n","- *Feature Extraction:* PCA can be used as a feature extraction technique to derive new features that capture the most important aspects of the data. The transformed principal components can be used as features in subsequent analysis tasks.\n","\n","By applying PCA, we can gain insights into the data's variance structure, reduce dimensionality, visualize high-dimensional data, remove noise, and extract meaningful features."],"metadata":{"id":"5mtwS3WMZ4Bj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X = breast_cancer.data  # Features\n","y = breast_cancer.target  # Labels"],"metadata":{"id":"jQI3VYmeTwa6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686101393225,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":188,"user":{"displayName":"Jorge Juárez","userId":"14535188974335101660"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)"],"metadata":{"id":"uVBrW3oacAa_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686101395801,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":158,"user":{"displayName":"Jorge Juárez","userId":"14535188974335101660"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In PCA, the `explained_variance_ratio_` and `components_` attributes provide important insights into the transformed data and the contribution of each principal component.

Use `components_` to inspect the coefficients or weights of the original features in each principal component.

Features with similar signs and magnitudes in different components may indicate common patterns or correlations.\n","5. Consider the cumulative contribution of the selected principal components.
